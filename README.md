# Python-quiz-application
This is a simple Python quiz application that asks users a series of questions and checks their answers. The application provides feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or not.

The quiz includes three questions, each with multiple-choice options. The user can enter their answer using the numbered options provided.

The code for this quiz application follows best practices in Python programming, including:

- Using lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate data
- Defining functions to encapsulate reusable code
- Using conditional statements to check user input and provide feedback
- Using loops to iterate over data structures and perform actions on each item

To use this code, simply copy and paste it into a file named `quiz.py` and run it using a Python interpreter. The quiz application will ask you a series of questions, and you can enter your answers using the numbered options provided. The application will then provide feedback on whether your answers are correct or not and calculate your final score.

This code serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in learning Python programming or creating their own quiz applications.
